# Spot-Clone

Spot-Clone is a clone of the popular music streaming service Spotify. It uses the official Spotify API to fetch data and play music. It is built using React, Context API, and FontAwesome Icons.

## Run From Source

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/ChiragAgg5k/spot-clone.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## What It Can't Do

-   It can't play full length songs as it uses the Spotify API which only allows 30 seconds of playback.
-   It can't search for songs within the playlists just yet.
-   It can't load songs other than the ones in the user's playlists.
