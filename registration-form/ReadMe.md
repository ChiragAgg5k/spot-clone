# Registration Form

This is a simple registration form made using HTML and CSS. It is a responsive form which can be used for any website. I followed freeCodeCamp's tutorial to make this form. You can find the tutorial [Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-html-forms-by-building-a-registration-form).
